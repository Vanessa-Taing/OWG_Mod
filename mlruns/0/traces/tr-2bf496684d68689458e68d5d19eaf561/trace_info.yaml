  objects include a green pear and a hammer.\n\n2) Grasp Pose Contacts:\n   - Pose
  1: The fingers (blue lines) are close to the hammer, potentially leading to contact.\n
  \  - Pose 2: The fingers are positioned without contact with surrounding objects.\n
  \  - Pose 3: The fingers are close to the hammer, potentially leading to contact.\n\n3)
  Ranked Grasp Poses:\n   - Best: Pose 2 (no contact, centered)\n   - Pose 1 (potential
  contact with hammer)\n   - Pose 3 (potential contact with hammer)\n\n4) Ambiguities:
  No ambiguity.\n\nMy final answer is: [2, 1, 3]\nUncertainty: No ambiguity."
