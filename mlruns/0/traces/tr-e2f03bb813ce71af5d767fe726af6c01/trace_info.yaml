response_preview: "1) The object of interest is a rectangular box outlined in green.
  Surrounding it is a blue object and another red box.\n\n2) Grasp poses leading to
  contacts:\n   - Pose 1: No contact with surrounding objects.\n   - Pose 2: Contacts
  the blue object.\n   - Pose 3: No contact with surrounding objects.\n   - Pose 4:
  Contacts the blue object.\n\n3) Ranked list of grasp poses from best to worst:\n
  \  - Pose 3: Centered and contact-free.\n   - Pose 1: Contact-free but slightly
  off-center.\n   - Pose 2: Contacts the blue object.\n   - Pose 4: Contacts the blue
  object.\n\n4) Ambiguities:\n   - No ambiguity in determining contacts; visibility
  is clear.\n\nMy final answer is: [3, 1, 2, 4]\nUncertainty: \"No ambiguity.\""
