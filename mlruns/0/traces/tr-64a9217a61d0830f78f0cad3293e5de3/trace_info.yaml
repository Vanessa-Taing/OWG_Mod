response_preview: "1) The object of interest is a red rectangular box. Surrounding
  it are a green pear and a hammer.\n\n2) Grasp pose analysis:\n   - Pose 1: The blue
  lines (fingers) are close to the hammer, potentially leading to contact.\n   - Pose
  2: The blue lines are positioned away from surrounding objects, avoiding contact.\n
  \  - Pose 3: The blue lines are close to the hammer, potentially leading to contact.\n\n3)
  Ranking of grasp poses from best to worst:\n   - Pose 2: No contact and close to
  the center.\n   - Pose 1: Potential contact with the hammer.\n   - Pose 3: Potential
  contact with the hammer.\n\n4) Uncertainty: No ambiguity.\n\nMy final answer is:
  [2, 1, 3]\nUncertainty: No ambiguity."
